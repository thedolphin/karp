    # Request compression from Karp Server

    # compression: ""

# Stream relays messages from named Karp Server to named Kafka cluster
# Depending on the message flow rate, you can specify multiple topics 
# within a single stream, set the number of connections (threads) within one stream,
# or do both. Therefore, you do need to understand how topics and
# partitions work — shocking, I know.

# Definition of streams
streams:

  - source: my_karp_server
    sink: my_kafka_cluster
      # Map of topics to subscribe to,
      # and their destination names.
      # Empty means same name
    topics:
      my.topic: # as is
      my.test.topic: copy.of.my.test.topic

    # Repartition topics
    # hash - repartition by key hash
    # source - set partition as in source
    # roundrobin - round-robin repartition
    # partitioning: source

    # Number of threads (connections, clients) per stream,
    # each thread shares the pool of partitions
    # threads: 1

    # Per stream compression setting
    # Possible values: snappy, lz4, gzip, zstd
